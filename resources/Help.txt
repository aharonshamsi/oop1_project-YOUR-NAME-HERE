Bomberman is a strategy game where the goal is to destroy obstacles,
defeat enemies, and find the exit to complete the level. 
Players place bombs that detonate after a short delay and must 
avoid getting caught in the explosions caused by themselves or enemies.
Throughout the game, power-ups can be collected to enhance abilities, 
such as increasing blast radius, moving faster, or placing more bombs.
The game combines planning, agility, and quick thinking to achieve victory.
